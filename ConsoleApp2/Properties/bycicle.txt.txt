To ride a bicycle, the rider sits on the seat and places the feet on the pedals. The pedals are connected by a chain to the back wheel. When the rider pushes on the pedals, the back wheel turns. This moves the bicycle forward. The rider steers by turning the handlebars or by leaning.

Bicycles may have coaster brakes or hand brakes. On a bicycle with coaster brakes, a rider stops by pedaling backward. Hand brakes are controlled using levers on the handlebars. When a rider squeezes the levers, pads squeeze against the wheels and the bicycle stops.

Some bicycles also have gears, or speeds. Shifting, or changing, gears lets the rider keep a steady pedaling speed when traveling on different surfaces. Higher gears make pedaling harder but allow the bicycle to go faster. A rider may shift the bicycle into a higher gear when riding on smooth, flat ground. Lower gears make pedaling easier but slow down the bicycle. A rider may shift to a lower gear when riding up a hill.

There are six main types of bicycles: utility, mountain, hybrid, touring, racing, and bicycle motocross (BMX). Utility bicycles have heavy frames and usually one speed. Mountain bikes have wide tires, flat handlebars, and many speeds. They are good for riding on rough trails. Hybrid bicycles are like mountain bikes, but their tires are not as wide. They are good for both roads and off-road trails. Touring and racing bicycles have narrow tires, lightweight frames, curved handlebars, and many speeds. They are often called road bikes because they are best for riding on roads. BMX bikes are designed for racing on dirt tracks. BMX bikes have a small frame, a low seat, high handlebars, and one speed.

The first machines similar to bicycles were invented in the early 1800s. They had no pedals. Later machines had pedals and front wheels that were much larger than the back wheels. The front wheels were about 5 feet (1.5 meters) tall. By about 1900 bicycles looked similar to the bicycles of today.
